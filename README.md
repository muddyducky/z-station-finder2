# ðŸš‰ Z Station App â€“ Mission 5 Side Project

Z Station App is a full-stack web application built with the MERN tech stack. It helps users locate nearby train stations through an interactive map and dynamic search interface.

> ðŸ”„ This version was developed as a practice using a **different wireframe** from another station-finder project in my portfolio. While both share core features, this build explores an alternate design approach and UI flow, showcasing my ability to adapt and reimplement functionality across different layouts.
